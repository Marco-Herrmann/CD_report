\section*{Introduction}

This \LaTeX file gives additional instructions how we expects students to write thier report within the Computational Dynamics group. It is an extension on the Dynamics \& Control template. Herein, we give help on
%
\begin{itemize}
	\item writing down equations and using the provided commands, 
	\item making mechanical drawings in inkscape, 
	\item exporting simulation results (from cardillo),
	\item creating figures with pgf plots.
\end{itemize}
%
\section{Writing equations and usefull commands}
%
Extending the nomenclature of the template, we use lowercase letters to indicate scalar variables, i.e., $c \in \mR$, bold lowercase letters to indicate vector quantities, i.e., $\vv \in \mR^3$ and bold uppercase letters to indicate matrix quantites, i.e., $\vA \in \mR^{3 \times 3}$. Since these are very common in mechanical reports, the file \textbf{header.tex} contains a lot of usefull commands to write down these bold characters by writing $\backslash$vv or $\backslash$vA in these example. Also bold greek letters are included with a similar structure to make writing down equations even more simple. We can write for example 
%
\begin{equation}
	\vga = \dot{\vg}
	\textAND
	\vLa = \int \vla \diff[t]
	\, .
\end{equation}
%
Also have a look at the other commands, allowing you to write calligraphic and fracture letters if needed. 

During the process of writing the report, you might indicate some changes in the text, or you want to put down a placeholder or a question directly. You can do so by using \correctb{$\backslash$correctb}, \correctr{$\backslash$correctr}, \correcto{$\backslash$correcto}, \todo{$\backslash$todo} and \question{$\backslash$question}.

\section{Drawing in inkscape}
%
\subsection*{Lines}
\todo{Stolen from INM template}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Very thick 0.6 mm
	\item thick 0.4 mm
	\item thin 0.2 mm
	\item very thin 0.1 mm
	\item tip of an arrow: 15$^\circ$
\end{itemize}
One should mainly use thick and thin

\subsection*{Mechanical models}
%
\begin{itemize}
	\item thick (0.4 mm): Body contours, forces and moments
	\item thin (0.2 mm): Coordinate systems, geometric measurements, hatching, guide lines, springs, dampers, gravitational acceleration
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Computed lines}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Coordinate systems: 0.2 mm
	\item additional measurements: 0.2 mm
	\item individual functions: 0.4 mm
	\item sets of functions: 0.2 mm, to highlight individual ones: 0.4 mm
	\item coordinate grid: 0.1 mm (if neccessary)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Adding text on drawings}

To finish the drawing,
